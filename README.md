# 2048 Game – Python & Pygame

A smooth and functional recreation of the classic **2048 puzzle game**, built using **Python** and **Pygame**. This was my **first Python project**, inspired by [Clear Code's 2048 tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZyylFcjfIg). I followed the guide closely but also made several changes and customizations to learn and practice Python and Pygame fundamentals.
